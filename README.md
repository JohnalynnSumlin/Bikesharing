# Bikesharing

## Overview/Purpose
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:
* Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
* Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
* Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results
